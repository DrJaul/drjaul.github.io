        <p>The Shadowrun (5e) Cyberdeck Configuration Helper solves the persistent table problem of juggling hardware stats, software suites, and situational modifiers in the heat of a run. It is written for game masters, deckers, and technomancers who need a quick way to balance legality, cost, and dice pools without rifling through multiple books mid-session. The helper guides players through configuring a legal or illicit deck step by step, keeps track of attack, sleaze, data processing, and firewall ratings, and flags potential issues before a plan goes live. Alongside numeric summaries, it offers interpretive copy that explains why specific loadouts shine for reconnaissance, brute-force intrusions, or surgical data heists. By centralizing calculations and reminders in an approachable interface, it frees the table to focus on fiction-forward decisions instead of spreadsheet wrangling. Every description is authored from scratch to keep the resource compliant with publisher policies.</p>

          <h4>Overview &amp; Purpose</h4>
          <p>The Shadowrun Cyberdeck Configuration Helper exists to shrink the overhead that slows down matrix-focused encounters. When a player needs to spec a deck under tight timelines, the app walks them through hardware selection, module swaps, and persona stat adjustments without requiring them to memorize every table from the core rulebook. It doubles as a teaching aid for new deckers by surfacing contextual notes on what each rating does and how it impacts matrix perception, hacking on the fly, or resisting ICE countermeasures. Veteran players use it as a pre-run checklist to catch illegal combinations or gaps in defensive coverage before they dive into the grid. The overall goal is to give Shadowrun groups a fast, reliable path from character concept to actionable matrix loadout, ensuring play sessions stay narrative-rich rather than rules-bound.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>How It Works</h4>
          <p>The helper runs entirely in the browser using jQuery for DOM updates and lightweight state management. When you open the tool, the app loads a catalog of core-book decks, dongles, and persona modules. As you toggle components, event listeners recalculate attack, sleaze, data processing, and firewall on the fly and surface comparisons against baseline archetypes. The UI highlights when a selection exceeds device limits or violates legality thresholds, prompting you to reconsider or log it for a risky job. Behind the scenes, the configuration is stored in local variables and mirrored to localStorage so that refreshing the page restores your latest build. Because it is static, no data ever leaves your device. The interface also adds contextual helper text that explains why certain modules pair well, helping newcomers understand the ripple effects of their choices without reproducing any proprietary lore.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Data &amp; Storage</h4>
          <p>The tool keeps all configuration data on your device using localStorage. Stored values include the selected base deck, attached dongles, persona module choices, and optional notes you enter for mission prep. No personal information, email addresses, or character backstories are uploaded or logged. Clearing your browser cache or using the in-app reset option deletes these values immediately.</p>

          <h4>Attribution &amp; Copyright</h4>
          <p>The Shadowrun setting and terminology belong to their respective rights holders. This helper only references mechanical terms that are necessary for fan-made compatibility and does not reproduce copyrighted rulebook text. All interface copy, explanations, and supporting tips were written by Alex Likos specifically for this tool. <strong>What we don’t include:</strong> proprietary stories, adventure hooks, or verbatim paragraphs from published supplements.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Tips and Examples</h4>
          <p>Start by choosing the deck that matches your character’s license rating, then layer on dongles to patch weak stats. A stealth runner might prioritize raising sleaze with stealth dongles and hot-sim modules, while a combat decker invests in firewall and biofeedback protection for survivability. Use the compare view to record two or three loadouts tailored for scouting, extraction, or overwatch duties. Right before a run, toggle mission conditions such as noise or host rating to see how the deck holds up, and print the summary sheet as a quick reference card for the table.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>AITree grew out of a classroom challenge to help students picture how heuristic search unfolds when more than two dimensions are involved. The simulator tackles the pain point of abstract AI diagrams feeling disconnected from the messy, branching decisions made in real-time strategy or survival games. It is intended for educators, hobbyist programmers, and designers who want to tinker with cost functions, pruning strategies, and environmental weights without building a whole visualization pipeline from scratch. The project renders every node as a fully realized three-dimensional growth spur, allowing learners to pause iterations, toggle heuristics, and compare the resulting foliage-like structures. Because the interface maps each branch to the logic that generated it, students can see when aggressive pruning causes brittle tactics or when looser heuristics explode into exponential growth. All explanations are original and focus on practical insight rather than quoting any academic paper verbatim.</p>

          <h4>Overview &amp; Purpose</h4>
          <p>AITree is a sandbox that turns search algorithms into something you can watch grow rather than read about. Instructors can project the simulator to show students how tweaks to branching factors or evaluation functions change the look and feel of a decision tree. Indie developers use it to prototype enemy behavior, pacing adjustments, or resource distribution without committing code to a shipping build. Because the experience is rooted in interactive visuals, participants quickly connect each knob they twist to the patterns that unfold on screen. The project also doubles as a communication device when pitching AI-heavy mechanics to stakeholders who prefer visuals over white papers. By presenting everything inside a cohesive viewer with responsive controls, AITree keeps the learning curve gentle while still surfacing the deep logic behind each branch expansion.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>How It Works</h4>
          <p>The simulator ingests a seed scenario that defines environmental weights, branching limits, and heuristic scoring. From there it applies configurable search routines—depth-first, breadth-first, or hybrid layered sweeps—to expand nodes. As each node resolves, the engine assigns geometry to represent growth direction, scale, and color saturation tied to the current score. The visualization updates live, letting you scrub the timeline or pause to inspect a single branch. When you toggle a new heuristic, a new layer of growth sprouts using the updated rule set so you can compare evolution paths side by side. All calculations take place locally within the Unity project, and the exported build writes state snapshots only to the device running the simulation. The source code is organized into modular scripts so teams can swap in their own AI controllers without rewriting the renderer.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Data &amp; Storage</h4>
          <p>The open-source repository stores configuration presets as JSON files inside the project folder. When you run the simulator, those presets load into memory and any changes you make remain on your machine unless you explicitly export them. No telemetry, analytics, or personal information is collected. Clearing the application data folder removes local presets and cache files.</p>

          <h4>Attribution &amp; Copyright</h4>
          <p>AITree is an original research prototype published under permissive open-source licensing by Alex Likos. All explanatory text, tutorials, and walkthrough comments were written specifically for this project. <strong>What we don’t include:</strong> excerpts from textbooks, licensed art assets, or proprietary algorithms sourced from commercial games.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Tips and Examples</h4>
          <p>For classroom use, begin with a simple breadth-first preset so students can see balanced growth, then introduce heuristics that weight resource scarcity to illustrate pruning. Designers can duplicate a preset and adjust branch penalties to test how boss encounters might escalate over time. Researchers exploring accessibility can lower time-step intervals to let viewers inspect decisions at a comfortable pace, then export screenshots of contrasting growth patterns for documentation.</p>
